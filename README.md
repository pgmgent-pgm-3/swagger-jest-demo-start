# Swagger / Jest Demo Start

## Documenting met Swagger en Testing met JEST

Swagger is used for documenting an API via the openAPI standard (v.3).

The students learn how to implement swagger via [swagger-ui-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express). 

The second topic is based around JEST, a testing framework. Students learn how to write unit tests and how to test javascript components. During this week, the students get the briefing of the final assignment for this course.
